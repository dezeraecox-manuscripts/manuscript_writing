# Introduction

This template is based on the Overleaf template provided by the Biophysical Journal and uses modifications to this template provided by [Quarto Journals](https://github.com/quarto-journals/biophysical-journal).

Your introduction goes here.


# Materials and Methods

Your methods go here.


# Results


Some examples of commonly used commands and features are listed below, to help you get started.

Leave a blank line between blocks of text to start a new paragraph.

References can be included between square brackets using the citation keys available in your references.bib, for example we are using quarto [@quarto].

Figures and Tables can be referenced in line like this @tbl-numbers.

Quarto is also great at typesetting mathematics using LaTeX:

  Let $X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_n$ be a sequence of independent and identically
  distributed random variables with $\text{E}[X_i] = \mu$ and
  $\text{Var}[X_i] = \sigma^2 < \infty$, and let
  $$
  S_n = \frac{X_1 + X_2 + \cdots + X_n}{n}
        = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i}^{n} X_i
  $${#eq-clt}
  denote their mean.
  Then as $n$ approaches infinity, the random variables $\sqrt{n}(S_n - \mu)$ converge
  in distribution to a normal $\mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2)$.
  Thus concludes the explanation about @eq-clt.

## Figures and Tables

Here is a table (or not, this is LaTeX, so it will put it wherever it wants. "Here" is very relative...).

|Thing   | Value  |
|:-------|-------:|
|A 42    |      18|
|B 15    |      18|
|C 34    |      17|
|D 99    |      24|

: This is the table caption. Look, numbers! You can allow this table to be referenced elsewhere in the document by including a tag. {#tbl-numbers}


You may prefer to include tables and figures directly in the relevant results sections - this is fine! The syntax is the same, and the labels will be updated automatically. 

You can add a page break directly using:

\NewPage

# Supplementary Material

I like to store supplementary figures in a separate file, such that the standalone PDF containing the supplementary info can be independently created. However, to make the supplementary figures referenceable here we need to include them!

First, we reset the figure and table counter using the following command:

\beginsupplement

Then, add the supplementary figures.

{{< include figures/suppfigures.qmd >}}
